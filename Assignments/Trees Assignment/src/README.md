The Main class simply calls the others and puts the pieces together to run the program. The BST.java and AVL.java classes contain the implementation of a Binary Search Tree and an AVL Tree, with methods like insert, remove, traverse etc.
The TreeNode.java class contains the base architecture of a Tree Node, which is inherited by both the BST and AVL classes.
The remaining classes simply provide implementations of the BST and AVL Tree
